## 1.4 Ordered Fields

* A field cannot capture all the properties of $\mathbb{Q}$:
    * $\mathbb{Q}$ has infinite number of elements.
    * There is an order for each number.
    * There is metric for a pair of numbers.

***Definition 1.7*** An _ordered field_ is a field $\mathbb{F}$ along with the following axioms:

***Axiom 6*** (Ordered Axiom). There is a nonempty subset $P \subseteq \mathbb{F}$, called positive elements, such that 

(a) if $a, b \in P$, then $a + b \in P$ and $a \cdot b \in P$;

(b) if $a \in \mathbb{F}$ and $a \neq 0$, then either $a \in P$ or $-a \in P$, but not both.

***Notes 1***: $1 \in P$. Proof by contradiction. Assume the other way: $-1 \in P$. Then based on (a), $-1 \cdot -1 = 1 \in P$. This contradicts (b).

***Notes 2***: $0 \in P$? I cannot prove.
